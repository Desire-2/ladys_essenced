# Security Best Practices - Lady's Essence

## Environment Security

### Secret Keys
- Generate strong JWT secrets (minimum 32 characters, 256 bits)
- Use different secrets for development and production
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Rotate secrets regularly

### Example Secret Generation
```bash
# Generate secure secrets
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Database Security

### Production Database Setup
1. **Use PostgreSQL** (not SQLite) for production
2. **Create dedicated database user** with minimal permissions
3. **Enable SSL/TLS** for database connections
4. **Regular backups** with encryption
5. **Network isolation** (private subnets)

### Database Configuration Example
```sql
-- Create dedicated user
CREATE USER ladys_essence_user WITH PASSWORD 'strong_password';
CREATE DATABASE ladys_essence OWNER ladys_essence_user;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE ladys_essence TO ladys_essence_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO ladys_essence_user;
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO ladys_essence_user;
```

## Application Security

### CORS Configuration
```python
# Restrict origins in production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
```

### Rate Limiting
Consider implementing rate limiting for:
- Authentication endpoints
- USSD endpoints
- API endpoints

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated
- SQL injection prevention (using SQLAlchemy)
- XSS prevention (framework built-in)

## Deployment Security

### Docker Security
- Run containers as non-root user
- Use official base images
- Regular security updates
- Minimal container permissions

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS/TLS in production
- Firewall configuration
- Private networking for database
- Regular security patches

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Production .env template
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@private-host:5432/dbname
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-generated-256-bit-secret
SECRET_KEY=your-generated-256-bit-secret
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Database connection failures
- Application errors

### Log Management
- Centralized logging
- Log rotation
- Security event alerting
- Regular log analysis

## Backup and Recovery

### Database Backups
```bash
# Automated PostgreSQL backup
pg_dump -h hostname -U username -d database_name > backup.sql
```

### Application Backups
- Code repository (Git)
- Environment configurations
- User uploaded files
- Database backups

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- User consent management
- Data retention policies
- Right to deletion
- Data encryption at rest

### Health Data Privacy
- HIPAA compliance considerations
- Data anonymization
- Secure data transmission
- Audit trails

## Security Checklist

### Before Production Deployment

- [ ] PostgreSQL database with dedicated user
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS enabled
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] Container security hardened
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Security testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Regular Security Maintenance

- [ ] Security patches applied
- [ ] Dependencies updated
- [ ] Secrets rotated
- [ ] Backups tested
- [ ] Security logs reviewed
- [ ] Access permissions audited

## Emergency Response

### Security Incident Response
1. Identify and contain the threat
2. Assess the impact
3. Implement fixes
4. Notify affected users (if required)
5. Document the incident
6. Update security measures

### Contact Information
- Security team contact
- Infrastructure team contact
- Legal/compliance team contact

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regular reviews and updates are essential.
