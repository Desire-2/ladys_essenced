# Cycle Info Calculation Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
In the USSD menstrual health app's "6. Update Cycle Info" feature, there was a mismatch between the menu options displayed and their actual functionality:

### Issues Found:
1. **Menu Option Mismatch**: Menu showed "3. View data sources" and "4. Reset to calculated averages", but option 3 was implementing reset functionality instead of showing data sources.
2. **Missing Functionality**: The "View data sources" feature (option 3) was not implemented.
3. **Navigation Gap**: No way for users to see which cycles were being used for average calculations.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Menu Option Mapping
**File**: `/backend/app/routes/ussd.py` (lines 789-815)

**Before**:
```python
elif selection == '3':
    # Reset to use calculated averages (WRONG - should be option 4)
    user.has_provided_cycle_info = False
    # ... reset logic
```

**After**:
```python
elif selection == '3':
    # View data sources - show recent cycles used for calculations
    recent_cycles = CycleLog.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id).filter(
        CycleLog.end_date.isnot(None),
        CycleLog.cycle_length.isnot(None)
    ).order_by(CycleLog.start_date.desc()).limit(6).all()
    
    # ... implementation for showing cycle data sources
    
elif selection == '4':
    # Reset to use calculated averages (NOW CORRECT)
    user.has_provided_cycle_info = False
    # ... reset logic
```

### 2. Added Data Sources View Feature
**New functionality for option 3**:
- Shows the recent cycles used for average calculations
- Displays cycle length and period length for each cycle
- Handles case when no data is available
- Provides proper navigation back to cycle info menu

**Example output**:
```
üìä Recent cycles used for calculations:

1. 15 Dec 2024: 28d cycle, 5d
2. 17 Nov 2024: 30d cycle, 6d 
3. 20 Oct 2024: 26d cycle, 4d
4. 22 Sep 2024: 29d cycle, 5d
5. 25 Aug 2024: 27d cycle, 4d

üí° Using last 5 cycles for averages
0. Back
00. Main Menu
```

### 3. Enhanced Navigation Handling
**File**: `/backend/app/routes/ussd.py` (lines 860-870)

Added proper navigation handling for the data sources view:
```python
elif input_list[2] == '3':  # Data sources view navigation
    if selection == '0':
        return handle_cycle_tracking(user, input_list[:2])  # Back to cycle info menu
    elif selection == '00':
        return main_menu(user)
    else:
        return "END Invalid selection."
```

### 4. Existing Calculation Logic Verification
The underlying calculation logic was already correct:
- ‚úÖ Only includes completed cycles (with `end_date` and `cycle_length`)
- ‚úÖ Handles missing period data gracefully  
- ‚úÖ Shows "No period data" when no cycles have period information
- ‚úÖ Calculates accurate averages from available data

## Testing Results

### Calculation Logic Test
```bash
$ python test_cycle_calculation_logic.py
üß™ Starting Cycle Info Calculation Tests...

üßÆ Testing cycle info calculation logic...
Completed cycles: 6
Average cycle length: 28.0 days
Cycles with period data: 5
Average period length: 4.8 days
‚úÖ Calculation logic is correct!

üîç Testing edge cases...
‚úÖ Edge cases handled correctly!

üìã Testing menu structure...
‚úÖ Menu structure is correct!

üéâ All cycle info calculation tests passed!
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix:
- Option 3 ("View data sources") actually reset user data
- No way to see which cycles were used for calculations
- Confusing menu behavior

### After Fix:
- Option 3 correctly shows data sources
- Option 4 correctly resets to calculated averages  
- Users can see exactly which cycles are used for their averages
- Transparent calculation process builds user trust
- Proper navigation in and out of all menu options

## Menu Structure (Now Correct)

```
üîß Cycle Information Management:
üìä Current Settings:
Personal cycle: 28 days
Personal period: 5 days
Data provided: Yes

üìà Calculated from logs:
Avg cycle: 28.0 days
Avg period: 4.8 days
Completed cycles: 5

1. Update cycle length
2. Update period length
3. View data sources      ‚Üê Now correctly implemented
4. Reset to calculated averages  ‚Üê Moved from option 3
0. Back
00. Main Menu
```

## Summary
The cycle info calculation feature now works perfectly with:
- ‚úÖ Accurate average calculations
- ‚úÖ Proper menu option mapping
- ‚úÖ Data transparency (users can see source cycles)
- ‚úÖ Robust navigation
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of missing data
- ‚úÖ Clear user feedback and error messages

The fixes ensure users have complete visibility into how their cycle predictions are calculated and full control over their personal cycle information.
