Enhanced USSD Features Demonstration

This file shows the new features implemented:

1. CYCLE PREDICTIONS WITH MONTHLY NAVIGATION
================================================
- Predictions now show one month at a time instead of 3 cycles
- Users can navigate using 'n' for next month and 'p' for previous month
- Month names are displayed (e.g., "Predictions for July 2025")
- Shows cycles that fall within the selected month only
- Includes tips and phase information

Example USSD Flow:
*123*1*5#  ‚Üí Access Cycle Predictions
Current month predictions shown
'n' ‚Üí Next month predictions
'p' ‚Üí Previous month (if not at current month)

2. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING FOR PERIOD LOGGING
==============================================
The period start and end logging now includes comprehensive error checking:

PERIOD START ERRORS:
- Invalid date format: "‚ùå Invalid date format. Please use DD-MM-YYYY"
- Future dates: "‚ùå Period start date cannot be in the future"
- Too old dates: "‚ùå Period start date is too far in the past (6+ months)"
- Active period exists: "‚ùå You have an active period... End it first"
- Duplicate dates: "‚ùå A cycle already exists for this date"
- Too close to existing cycles: "‚ö†Ô∏è This date is very close to an existing cycle"

PERIOD END ERRORS:
- Invalid date format validation
- End date before start date: "‚ùå Period end date cannot be before start date"
- No active period: "‚ùå No active period found to end"
- Unusually long periods: "‚ö†Ô∏è Period duration of X days seems unusually long"
- Helpful feedback based on period length

3. SESSION STATE MANAGEMENT
===========================
- Month navigation state is preserved during the session
- Back navigation works properly through all levels
- Session data is cleared when returning to main menu

4. ENHANCED USER FEEDBACK
=========================
- Clear error messages with emojis and explanations
- Helpful tips and educational content
- Context-aware suggestions based on cycle patterns

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Fixed datetime/date type mismatches
- Better database error handling with rollback
- Session state tracking for navigation
- Comprehensive input validation
- Edge case handling for various scenarios

The system now provides a much more robust and user-friendly experience
for menstrual health tracking through USSD.
